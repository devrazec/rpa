# Exploring and Understanding the Use of RPA in Enterprise Systems

This repository contains the implementation and demonstration code developed as part of the Master’s thesis **“Exploring and Understanding the Use of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) in Enterprise Systems”**, completed in 2025 by **Cezar**.  

The project investigates how RPA can be customized and integrated into enterprise systems to improve efficiency, scalability, and return on investment.

## 📖 Overview

Robotic Process Automation (RPA) allows organizations to automate repetitive and rule-based tasks by using software robots that emulate human interactions.  
In this project, an **Action Research methodology** was applied in collaboration with **Desion GmbH**, a German company specialized in AI and computer vision, to automate the acquisition of high-quality image datasets for training machine learning models.  

The solution was developed using **Puppeteer**, a Node.js library for browser automation.

## 🚀 Features

- Automated navigation across multiple websites  
- Extraction of product images and metadata (e.g., furniture descriptions)  
- Robust scraping with flexible selectors  
- Storage of collected images and structured data  
- Significant improvements in efficiency, error reduction, and scalability  

---

## 📊 Results

- **Cycle time reduction:** from 180s to 5s per image (97% faster)  
- **Error rate reduction:** from 12.5% to 2.8%  
- **Throughput:** from 100 images/day to 3,600 images/day  
- **Cost savings:** ~62.5% reduction in labor costs
